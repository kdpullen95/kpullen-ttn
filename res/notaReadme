To add a new Panel:

create a folder with the unique panel identifier you would like to use (ex. marysNewChatPanel)
place that folder within the panels folder
create three files: index.html, index.js, and server.js
these files require some basic functions.
Suggested, but not required, variables/lines are commented out. See below.

**index.html**

**index.js**

**server.js**
//var func;
//var prefix;

module.exports = {
  name: /* The human-readable name you want to appear in lists */,

  init: function(parent, folderName) {
    //func = parent; /*access shared functions, like "log"*/
    //prefix = manager.prefix.function + "  (" + folderName + ")"; /*matches log conventions*/
  },

  processMessage: function(message, mongo, socket, io) {

    return message; /*message should be formatted similarly to received message*/
  },
}
